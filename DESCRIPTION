Description: Small RNAs (sRNAs) constitute an important class of post-transcriptional
              regulators that control critical cellular processes in bacteria. While
              recent research has led to a dramatic increase in the discovery of bacterial sRNAs,
              it is generally believed that the currently identified sRNAs constitute a limited
              subset of the bacterial sRNA repertoire. In several cases, sRNAs belonging to
              a specific class are already known and the challenge is to identify additional
              sRNAs belonging to the same class. InvenireSRNA is an R package for learning
              a generalized classification model for any given class of sRNA thus allowing for
              the discovery of additional sRNAs belonging to the same class. InvenireSRNA
              also provides pretrained models for predicting RsmA/CsrA-regulating and toxT-
              regulated sRNAs.
